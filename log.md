### Day 1: July 13, 2016

**Today**: Set up repo. Made some stuff. Coded and forgot to push.

**Code**: Forgot to push but I am just going to go with it.

**Design**: Only gave myself 25 to make this. Trying to not over-think things.

**Feelings:** Tried to wrap my mind around this challenge. It makes me want to do other challenges because they make things interesting.
